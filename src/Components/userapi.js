        I swear I wasn‚Äôt thinking of you!\n
         I don‚Äôt succeed often in managing my thoughts when it comes to not thinking about you, but this time, I did. Even if it was for a day, that‚Äôs a big progress for me. I hate going outside anymore because my heart skips a bit every time I confuse another guy with you, which happens so many times. That leads me back to thinking about you, which instead shifts my mood to negativity and inserts me in a loop of trying to stop thinking about you. Anyways, I managed to break the loop this time, and I wasn‚Äôt even aware of it. My mind took me to a discovery of different physics theories to feed its curiosity, a way to distract me from thinking about you, and also a distaction from the to-do-lists that are waiting for me, about new things. There was no link between you and physics for my liking, so I was enjoying the journey. I was reading about quantum theories and how sophisticated they are. Trying to understand this concept in itself incules some sophisticated way of thinking that I was engaged with happily to keep my mind busy. Once I felt I understood it, another article blows me again, and I start from zero. Then this explanation eased my busy mind.
The mystery box experiment. The cat is both dead AND alive in the box until it is opened. It‚Äôs not dead OR alive. Quantum is as simple as that. Once I eased my mind with this logic, I went further in. A quantum computer! ‚ÄúOh that‚Äôs interesting‚Äù said to my mind applauding how it managed to keep myself busy with these things. Our computers are logical. Just as our minds. The bits can be either 0 or 1. Nothing else. Can they be 0 AND 1? I mean that‚Äôs not logical right! Then quantum jumps in to make that logic feel ashamed of itself. Bits can be 0 AND 1 simultaneously which is called the Superposition of two states. Now we can‚Äôt call them bits anymore because bits are 0 and 1. So these new weird bits were quantum bits hence qubits. This is beyond the explanation of classical physics. So scientists can measure the probability of the superposition states and calculate the state of the bit. Then comes this weird ability of scientists to control the states of two quantum units. Even Einstein called this property "spooky action at a distance." Not even quantum physics has a proper definition about this. So basically, it is the property of quantum units that show the same behavioral changes no matter the distance, once they are entangled. They can actually feel the change. Wait up! This has no connection with you calling and checking randomly if I was okay whenever I cried, right? Or me calling you exactly when you were about to call me for the zillionth times right? Or both of us, knowing from the beginning that it wasn‚Äôt just a chat with a stranger but a perfect fit for each other, RIGHT? Were we quantumly entangled to the point we understood each other from a distance without communication? But I came here to stop thinking about you! I continue. Too bad we‚Äôre not gonna use these quantum computers as our laptops in the near future. Well here‚Äôs why. Quantum qubits are so sensitive that the slightest vibrations can disrupt their superposition state. Scientists call this Quantum Decoherence. But if they survive the decoherence, these qubits can gain the Quantum Supermacy. Yes, as it‚Äôs name suggests supermacy, the ability of quantum computers to compute calculations that are beyond the ability of supercomputers at our time(because who knows what the future holds right!). I stop here as my mind is full of new information it will process for the next few days. A loong distraction. What a journey with physics today.
My conclusion : Quantum physics challenges the concept of classical physics as classical physics can not give a proper explanation for Quantum. Challenges often open new doors, new perspectives. I‚Äôm still not thinking about you, but are we gonna end up with a Quantum Decoherence affected by noises of our environment or work on solving the calculations so we can get the Quantum Supermacy?`

        ‚ÄòCome up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry\n\n
        You don't know how lovely you are
        I had to find you, tell you I need you
        Tell you I set you apart‚Äô
        \n
        The first lines of this music woke an unknown nostalgic feeling inside of me. My mind started rewinding back to older times just like the music clip of this song. I'm not sure if it's the melody or the lyrics taking me.
        
        ‚ÄòTell me your secrets and ask me your questions
        Oh, let's go back to the start
        Running in circles, coming up tails
        Heads on a science apart‚Äô
        \n
        
        Back to the times where songs were this good that if you listen to them after years, it would still give you the same goosebumps. Times where we were just kids wanting to be an adult so fast not knowing the beauty of our childhood times.
        
        ‚ÄòI was just guessing at numbers and figures
        Pulling the puzzles apart
        Questions of science, science and progress
        Do not speak as loud as my heart
        But tell me you love me, come back and haunt me
        Oh and I rush to the start‚Äô
        
        Times where our dreams were loud enough to reach the skies,
        our confidence so high we were sure we were gonna make it to the stars.
        Was it our overconfidence that broke our hearts
        or the untouchable height of our dreams that broke us?
        
        ‚ÄòRunning in circles, chasing our tails
        Coming back as we are‚Äô
        
        Back to when we were drawing circles on our school tables and erasing it immediately before the teacher caught us when we were wandering off. Oh how we hope to erase some circles we created that led us to a loop we cannot escape anymore. We didn't get the privilege of having a teacher that led us back to our dreams when we were wandering off our paths.
        
        ‚ÄòNobody said it was easy
        Oh, it's such a shame for us to part
        Nobody said it was easy
        No one ever said it would be so hard
        I'm going back to the start‚Äô
        
        We weren‚Äôt meant to part, tho. We just didn‚Äôt have the gut to stick and fight, to face the reality of our mistakes and correct, to step out of our overconfident self and be confident. So yes, we are going back to the start. The start of our dreams that reached the skies. But this time we know it‚Äôs not easy. We learned it is so hard to be apart.
        That‚Äôs why we will never give up.

        I‚Äôm not a master of feelings and how to deal with them. But if I ever have to say something about it, it would come out something like this:
        Or maybe, just maybe
        They were never meant to be , not compatible at all, but still went on with it, being stubborn on making it work out. Or maybe it was all coming from him. Wanting her badly made him blind to all the red flags. He saw the red flags actually , he was just ready to accept it for her. Now, he realizes her words were all full of lies. Or else how come someone with feelings be ignorant and careless like this. The biggest part of the pain came from knowing his worth to her. Comparing her worth to him, he was nothing to her. He will always be wondering where he did wrong, where he made a mistake, when and where exactly did the burning emotions of hers die. He knew she was afraid to lose him but not ready to claim him either. The one thing he can not do is being in the middle. That more than a friend, less than a lover relationship, that neither relationship nor friendship place she suggested. Works for her state perfectly, tho it‚Äôs not for someone who‚Äôs ready to burn himself for her. Unfinished conversations they have in between now, never meant to be finished. How difficult it is to live with wondering the other side‚Äôs feelings. Whether what they said was real or was they faking all of it. Curiosity killed the cat, but I bet the cat died satisfied.`

        title : "Why I didn‚Äôt get a score of 9 in IELTS",
        body : ` I ended up getting 8 in IELTS and here is why.
        1. I didn't practice.
I know you're probably saying taking IELTS without practice is a promised failure. Yes, it is. With the busy schedule I had, I didn't quite get enough time to practice for my exam ü•≤. Although I hadn't prepared for this exam, I was used to taking language exams. I never thought my 1 year Turkish preparation class would assist me in my English but, it did. I was used to the process of the exam: listening, reading , writing and speaking altogether. I had taken more than 10 exams of this kind, an indirect practice you can say, so that when I took the IELTS exam my brain did not stuck. I also had taken the IELTS before 6 years when I was in high school. Mind you I had completely forgotten how the exam was supposed to look like except for the part on how to do the reading part. If you're planning to get a good score in IELTS, practice practice practice. Take a minimum of 10 mock exams while setting the time. This will help you track your progress over time. There are plenty of sources out there for practice. I would recommend the British Council Test Taker Portal. You can get an access of over 30 mock tests when you register for IELTS

2. Reading the whole passage

Yes, you don't have to read the whole passage to answer the questions. Because if you do so, your most probably not going to finish in time. What I recommend is quickly reading the questions first. Then choose the questions you can answer without reading the whole passage. This might include questions about the meaning of a certain word or summary of a certain paragraph(if the paragraph is short give it a quick look). Then proceed to read the passage and answer the questions on the way. Some questions give you a hint where to focus on the passage.

3. Repeating your words.
What I noticed while I was taking the speaking exam was how I was using repeated words. You have to use different words to show the richness of your vocabulary. You have to express what you want to say using different words. This is important so try to add one vocabulary a day to widen your word capacity. Also adding multiple idioms is definitely a plus.

Remember the key is practice and more practice. With more practice you will definitely get the score you‚Äôre looking for. I wish you Good Luck from now.
